# TODO

## Refactoring Ideas
- **Maybe** Instead of *machines.py* and *models.py*, we can have *teacher.py*, *student.py*, *problem.py* and so on,
  where each file contains all its relevant models as well as State Machines.
- **Maybe** Replace `dataclass` with an alternative (`NamedTuple`, typed dict, etc.)
